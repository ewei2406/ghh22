    Filing a Federal Income Tax Return
</h1>
<h3>
    To file a tax return for the upcoming year, you need to know how much you made in the year prior. For example, to submit
    a tax return before April 19, 2022, you'd need to know how much you made in 2021. The steps to file are as following:

    <ol style=“list-style-type:square”>
    <li>
        Obtain paperwork including: 
        <ul style=“list-style-type:disc”>
        <li>
            W-2 form from each employer
        </li>
        <li>
            other earnings and interest statments like a 1099 and 1099-INT form
        </li>
        <li>
            receipts for charity donations and medical/business expenses
        </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Choose your filing status: single, married, divorced, etc. The percentage you pay for housing expenses also affects
        this.
    </li>
    <li>
        Determine how you're filing: it's recommended by the IRS to us tax preparation software to file electronically for easy and 
        more accurate returns. Sites like TurboTax, TaxAct, or H&R Block are good ways to e-file.
    </li>
    <li>
        Figure out if you're taking a standard deduction or itemizing your return.
        <ul style=“list-style-type:disc”>
            <li>
                the standard deduction amount is based on factors like your income, age, vision, and filing status
            </li>
            <li>
                you should itemize deductions if all of them are greater than your standard deduction or if you <i>must</i>
                itemize deductions due to inability to use the standard deduction
            </li>
            </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Learn how to make a tax payment if you owe money, which includes applying for a payment plan.
    </li>
    </ul>
