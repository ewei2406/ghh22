<h1>Welcome to FinEd!</h1>

Personal finance and management is generally not taught in K-12 education or even in universities, yet so much of our
lives will be affected by our knowledge (or lack thereof) of how to properly navigate our financial selves. It is a great source of
inequity in the United States, as financial literacy is only really known and passed down within wealthy, established families.

Our goal is to bring financial empowerment to everyone by making financial strategies and information more accessible to
everyone. Here we provide a place to learn and discuss freely about significant financial matters.

Feel free to take a look around and leave a comment!
