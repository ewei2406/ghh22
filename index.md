Personal finance and management is generally not taught in K-12 education and even in universities. Yet so much of our lives will be affected by our knowledge of (or lack of) how to navigate our financial selves. It is a great source of inequity in the United States, as financial literacy is only known and passed down within wealthy, established families.

Our goal is to bring financial empowerment to everyone by making financial stragies and information available to everyone. We provide a place to learn and discuss freely about financial matters.
