<h1>
    What Are Stocks
</h1>
<h3>
    Stocks, also known as equities, are representative of one's partial ownership in a company,
    so if someone buys a stock for a given company, they partially own that company.
    Stocks come in shares; the more shares bought, the more stock invested in the company.
    Companies will issue stock to earn money (referred to as capital) and grow their businesses. 
</h3>
<h3>
    There's two main stocks: <b>common</b> and <b>preffered</b> stock. The main differences between the two is that preferred stockholders
    are paid before common stockholders receive dividends, and that preferred stockholders don't typically have voting rights to
    shareholders. Additionally, preferred shares have higher dividend yields than common stockholders would receive, and if a company
    goes bankrupt, preferred stockholders have priority over liquidated assets.

<h1>
    The Stock Market
</h1>
<h3>
    The stock market is essentially just a large network of stock exchanges
    where traders and investors buy and sell shares of <i>publicly traded</i> companies.
    Exchanges with private companies are done a bit differently in that these companies will
    list stock shares through a process called <b>initial public offering (IPO)</b> where investors
    purchase shares and the company earns money. Once the company is listed on any stock exchange,
    it becomes a public company and investors can buy or sell the company's shares.
</h3>
<h3>
    There's two markets involved: the primary and secondary market. The primary mrket is where
    companies list their shares through IPOs, and the secondary market is the stock exchange, where
    supply and demand of shares are bought, traded, and sold daily.
</h3>
<h3>
    The world's largest stock exhange is the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), located in 
    Lower Manhattan in New York City with billions of trades occuring daily.

    Benefits and Risks
</h1>
<h3>
    Some of the benefits to stock investments are:
    <ul>
        <u>Amassing great wealth</u>: upon smart investments, and over long periods of time,
        the stock market generally averages a gain of +10%, so if roughly $5,000 is invested annually
        over an 8% growth rate, that $5,000 investment could turn into almost $250,000 within 20 years.
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <u>Simple way to make money</u>: you don't need to be a business major or even have annually
        knowledge regarding the ins and outs of the stock market. One lucky investment could be quite profittable
        at little to no effort put in. You <i>could</i> spend throrough research about conducting smarter investments,
        but anybody can make a stock exchange with even the smallest investments.
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <u>Staying ahead of inflation</u>: investing can help grow assets and stay on top of inflation. Over time, inflation
        averages close to +3% annually, while stocks generally make a 10% gain over a long period of time, whic allows
        investors to avoid losing their purchasing power.
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <u>Accessing funds easily</u>: stocks are primarily liquid; the markets are open almost every day
        of the week and you can buy and sell at any time then if need be by turning shares into cash with minimal
        transaction costs.
    </ul>
</h3>
<h3>
    Some of the risks to stock investments are:
    <ul>
        <u>Losing everything</u>: If a company performs poorly, investors will sell what they have, thus sending the stock prices
        crashing, and when selling, you lose your initial investment, which could be difficult if you can't
        afford to lose it. 
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <u>Time</u>: gaining wealth through stocks generally takes decades for a substantial return. While it's 
        possible to make a couple thousand dollars in stocks over a few years, you could be making hundreds of thousands
        over the span of a few decades. It's important to find a good balance between how much time to put into a company
        and how much return to settle for, otherwise you could miss out on massive gains, or spend too much time 
        only to come out with minimal earnings.
        
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <u>Staying ahead of inflation</u>: investing can help grow assets and stay on top of inflation. Over time, inflation
        averages close to +3% annually, while stocks generally make a 10% gain over a long period of time, whic allows
        investors to avoid losing their purchasing power.
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <u>Accessing funds easily</u>: stocks are primarily liquid; the markets are open almost every day
        of the week and you can buy and sell at any time then if need be. However, it's unwise to sell shares
        as you earn because of fluctuations in market prices.
    </ul>
