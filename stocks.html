<h1>
    What Are Stocks
</h1>
<h3>
    Stocks, also known as equities, are representative of one's partial ownership in a company,
    so if someone buys a stock for a given company, they partially own that company.
    Stocks come in shares; the more shares bought, the more stock invested in the company.
    Companies will issue stock to earn money (referred to as capital) and grow their businesses. 
</h3>
<h3>
    There's two main stocks: <b>common</b> and <b>preffered</b> stock. The main differences between the two is that preferred stockholders
    are paid before common stockholders receive dividends, and that preferred stockholders don't typically have voting rights to
    shareholders. Additionally, preferred shares have higher dividend yields than common stockholders would receive, and if a company
    goes bankrupt, preferred stockholders have priority over liquidated assets.

<h1>
    The Stock Market
</h1>
<h3>
    The stock market is essentially just a large network of stock exchanges
    where traders and investors buy and sell shares of <i>publicly traded</i> companies.
    Exchanges with private companies are done a bit differently in that these companies will
    list stock shares through a process called <b>initial public offering (IPO)</b> where investors
    purchase shares and the company earns money. Once the company is listed on any stock exchange,
    it becomes a public company and investors can buy or sell the company's shares.
</h3>
<h3>
    There's two markets involved: the primary and secondary market. The primary mrket is where
    companies list their shares through IPOs, and the secondary market is the stock exchange, where
    supply and demand of shares are bought, traded, and sold daily.
</h3>
<h3>
    The world's largest stock exhange is the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), located in 
    Lower Manhattan in New York City with billions of trades occuring daily.
